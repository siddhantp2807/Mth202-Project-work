Mth202 Simulation and Visualization

## Directories
1. AltSim/ - Contains Simulation Images  
2. DegDistribution/ - consists of images of Degree Distribution bar plots  
3. DegDistribution02/ and AgnProbDistribution/ - consists of P(X = k) vs k bar plots  
4. SimulationImg/ - consists of Simulation Images with clockwise-only connecting of points  
5. agnCurve/ - X vs r plots for 3/6/all values of N at once  
6. agnExpCurveFit/ and expCurveFit/ - Exponential curve fitting of all X vs r plots  
7. curves/ - X vs r plots for every value of N  
8. logPlot/ - log(X) vs log(r) plot for every value of N  
9. newDist/ - P(X = k) vs k plot alongwith power law curve fitting of the same  
10. powerCurve/ - Power curve fitting of X vs r plot  
  
## Files
1. another.py - Playground file to experiment out code  
2. createData.py - Run simulation and write simulation data to newData.json  
3. newReader.py - Tried out Binomial Distribution curve fitting, failed miserably :(  
4. play.py - Plots and visualises data from newData.json with some beautification  
5. readData.py - original file used to create visualisations and analogies from the simulation data
